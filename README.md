# Multiple Disease Prediction Streamlit App
https://onsite-health-diagnostic-webapp.streamlit.app/" here is the app link"

This repository contains the codebase for a Streamlit web application designed to predict multiple diseases. It includes the necessary scripts, notebooks, and datasets.

## Contents

1. `app.py`: This is the main Streamlit application code.
2. `requirements.txt`: This file lists all the Python libraries required to run the Streamlit app. You can install them using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. `notebooks/`: This directory contains Jupyter notebooks used for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
4. `datasets/`: This directory holds the datasets used for training and testing the predictive models.

## Installation

To set up the environment for running the Streamlit app, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project directory.

```bash
cd multiple-disease-prediction-streamlit-app
Install the required Python libraries by running:
bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Depending on your system configuration, you may need to install additional libraries for running the Jupyter notebooks. Please refer to the specific notebook instructions for any additional requirements.
Usage
After installing the dependencies, you can run the Streamlit app using the following command:

bash
Copy code
streamlit run app.py
This command will start a local server hosting the Streamlit app, and you can access it through your web browser.

Notebooks
The notebooks in the notebooks/ directory provide detailed steps for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation. Follow the instructions within each notebook to execute the code and reproduce the results.

Datasets
The datasets/ directory contains the datasets used for training and testing the predictive models. Ensure that the paths specified in the notebooks or the Streamlit app code match the location of these datasets on your local machine.
